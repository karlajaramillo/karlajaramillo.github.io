summary:    After finished my HTML &amp; CSS course by Shay Howe, I felt I had the foundations to start building my first web project. When tackling a project like this, it’s not strange that new questions come up, and I needed to start somewhere. I realized that I needed to find free, inspirational resources for my project needs, but that’s not so easy as you can imagine.

After finished my HTML &amp; CSS course by [Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/ "HTML &amp; CSS Course by Shay Howe"), I felt I had the foundations to start building my first web project. 

When tackling a project like this, it’s not strange that new questions come up, and I needed to start somewhere. I realized that I needed to find free, inspirational resources for my project needs, but that’s not so easy as you can imagine.

I'd been looking through so many websites, but with so much content available on the Internet these days, I decided to gather and share some of the websites that offer the most beautiful free content.

I hope you find them useful for your next project!
