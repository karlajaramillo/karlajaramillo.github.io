A code lover committed to finding out easy-to-use solutions to help users save time and effort.

I changed my path to dedicate my career to build intuitive and scalable solutions based on Javascript and HTML5. After 6 year of working experience in diverse businesses, from consulting through production & purchasing to marketing, I realized that this cross-cutting approach needs to be tailored with software development. Then, I had the opportunity to join the GIS community to learn about ESRI products, where I found out that I needed to dive into programming. 

I am determined to look for new ways to gain enriching experiences that allow me to grow in my developing career.
